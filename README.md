<h2 align="center">SPC Maker News</h2>

This is a responsive Hacker News UI alternative that allows for read-only interactions. While it was supposed to be a clone, within the timeframe the most useful thing this could be was an app that at least lets you see what's happening in the Hacker News universe—sort of like a news feed (newspapers??).

## UI Design

The design inspiration was largely based on [ModernHN](https://www.modernhn.com/), which is a web extension that gives Hacker News a more elegant appearance.

However, if you use the extension, you’ll notice it’s not responsive and the thread design is a bit lacking—though that might be intentional. We filled those minor gaps to give a more complete experience. Check out the Reddit-like lines we’ve added in the image below:

## AI Tools Used

The free versions of ChatGPT/OpenAI and Claude models. I usually prefer this approach over the integrated IDE method, as it lets me ask more about why a specific change was made and whether we could have approached it differently. That said, I’ve not used the AI code editors much. I mostly make the logic decisions—when to organize versus when to keep things in place. A large part of the UI (minus functionality) is generated by the model, and I cross-verify with my designs to ensure we’re on track.

If you need a picture of the workflow, think of it as a canvas with building blocks, where the AI model and I figure out what to do next, step by step.

## Thought and Build Process

We break, again break, and keep breaking down the problem until we can work on the smallest MVP while keeping future modifications in mind. For example, at the very start I focused solely on the UI without any functionality—the simple look needed to be there first, then we added functionality incrementally.

## Tech Stack

This is a React Vite app using TypeScript. It was the obvious choice for me given my prior experience.
